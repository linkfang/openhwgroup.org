Examples include, but are not limited to, Eclipse IoT sandbox servers, the User Storage Service, and the Automated Error Reporting Initiative.

By using this functionality, any information that you store or share (the “Stored Information”) will be subject to the <a href="https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/legalcode" target="_blank">CC0 1.0 Creative Commons</a> license, where, for purposes of that license, the Stored Information shall constitute the “Work” and you shall be the “Affirmer”. What that means is that anybody who accesses your information on the Internet has a worldwide, unrestricted, royalty free, irrevocable, perpetual, non-exclusive license to use, make, reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, transmit, sell, distribute, sublicense or otherwise transfer the Stored Information without any obligation to you, including any obligation of attribution.</p>

<p>Eclipse reserves the right to discontinue these services at any time or to remove any specific Stored Information from owned or controlled computer systems at any time, and Eclipse does not commit to making Stored Information available at all times in the future.</p>

<h3 id="licenses">Licenses</h3>

<p>Except for Content available through the UDS, and except as otherwise stated herein, the Content provided on this Web site is provided under the terms and conditions of the <a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl/notice.php" target="_blank">Eclipse Foundation Software User Agreement</a> and those additional terms, conditions and notices referenced therein.</p>

<p>If Content is licensed to you under the terms and conditions of a version of the Eclipse Public License (&rdquo;<a href="https://www.eclipse.org/legal/epl-2.0" target="_blank">EPL</a>&rdquo;), with respect to such Content, the term “Contributions” as used herein shall have the meaning provided in the EPL, and any such Contributions uploaded, submitted, or otherwise made available by you to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site shall be governed by the terms and conditions of the EPL and can be made available to others under the terms of the EPL.</p>

<p>If Content is licensed to you under license terms and conditions other than the EPL (&ldquo;Other License&rdquo;) with respect to such Content the term “Contributions “ as used herein shall mean any modifications, enhancements and/or other code and/or documentation related to such Content uploaded, submitted, or otherwise made available by you to the Eclipse Foundation and/or the Members and/or users of this Web site, and such Contributions shall be subject to and governed by the terms and conditions of the Other License. In addition, with regard to such Contributions, you agree to provide the Contributions under the terms and conditions of the EPL, provided however that the Eclipse Foundation shall have the right to reject any Contributions if the acceptance by the Eclipse Foundation would be in any way inconsistent with the Eclipse Foundation Intellectual Property Policy.</p>

<p>“Specification Content” is the collection of interface definitions for the application or user interfaces (“Interfaces”) provided by the work to which your Contribution was made, descriptions of the structure and semantic behavior of those Interfaces, and data formats and protocols associated with those Interfaces, all of which as are reasonably necessary to enable the development of independent implementations of those Interfaces. For the sake of clarity, Specification Content does not include implementation details of how the Eclipse project code or your Contribution implements the Interfaces in the Specification and the Specification Grant provide above would not cover such additional material.</p>

<p>To the extent you submit or otherwise make available to an Eclipse Foundation Specification Project (as that term is defined by the Intellectual Property Policy) any ideas, concepts, methods or other information, you agree that you will not assert, based on such submissions, any intellectual property rights that are essential to any implementation of the submission, against the OpenHW Group, its contributors, or its licensees, with respect to any implementation of such Specification (as that term is defined by the Eclipse Foundation Specification Process).
