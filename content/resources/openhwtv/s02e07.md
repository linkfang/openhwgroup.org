The CV32E4 family of open-source RISC-V CPUs is a set of processors that target embedded-class devices from edge-computing platforms to microcontrollers. This OpenHW Group TV episode shows the current state of projects surrounding the family of CORE-V IPs as: the CV32E40X for extending the computation capability of edge-nodes easily; the CV32E40S for secure applications; the CV32E20 for area-efficient microcontrollers; the CV32E40Pv2 project for completing the design and verification of the CV32E40P core for edge-computing platforms; and the CV32E41P for proving the newest Zfinx and Zce RISC-V ISA draft-extensions.

In particular, we will hear from Pascal Gouedo from the Dolphin Design team to discuss how the CV32E40Pv2 project is implemented and what are the strategies to complete it. Along with Tariq Kurd from Huawei who will describe why building the CV32E41P is important to rectify the Zfinx and Zce extensions.

The session speakers include: Pascal Gouedo, Dolphin Design; Tariq Kurd, Huawei; Davide Schiavone, OpenHW Group, and the session will be moderated by Rick Oâ€™Connor, OpenHW Group.
