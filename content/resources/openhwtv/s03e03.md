Open-source technologies have revolutionized industrial hardware and software development. These approaches are now bringing new energy to engineering education. Universities use open-source hardware and software to teach architectures and concepts while providing students hands-on experience with coding, design, and research.

In this webinar, we highlight the use of OpenHW Group CORE-V open-source RISC-V CPUs at leading Universities to teach CPU architecture, instruction-sets, and HW design. CORE-V platforms are used in bachelor’s level engineering coursework, at the master’s thesis level, and also in doctoral research. Students have contributed their work back to open-source projects at OpenHW Group, gaining valuable industrial experience. The PULP Training workshop developed by ETH Zurich compliments for-credit courses to help companies and universities start working with CORE-V CPUs and PULP microcontrollers.

The OpenHW TV presentation will be led by Davide Schiavone from OpenHW Group and Nils Wistoff from ETH Zurich.
