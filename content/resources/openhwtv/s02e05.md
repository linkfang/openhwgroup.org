This OpenHW TV episode highlights the motivation behind the OpenHW continuous integration (CI) environment and the benefits it delivers to open source development.

The episode (broadcast live on May 27) dives into the importance of continuous integration, takes a closer look at the OpenHW CI environment, and examines how CI is employed specifically within the CORE-V Verification Test Bench and the CORE-V MCU projects.

Additionally, the webinar explores the OpenHW core-v-verif GitHub repository, the distributed workflow in place, as well as the branching strategy used to manage multiple CORE-V core verification projects within a single repository.

The expert panel includes Tim Saxe (QuickLogic) and Aimee Sutton (Metrics) alongside Mike Thompson and Florian Zaruba (OpenHW Group).

There is a 30 minute Q&A session moderated by Rick O'Connor, OpenHW Group President and CEO after around 30 minutes of presentations.
