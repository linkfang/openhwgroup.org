We're just two weeks away from our next live webinar that highlights the motivation behind the OpenHW continuous integration (CI) environment and the benefits it delivers to open-source development. The webinar, with a live Q&A session, is being broadcast live on Thursday May 27 at 11am Eastern.

The episode dives into the importance of continuous integration, takes a closer look at the OpenHW CI environment, and examines how CI is employed specifically within the CORE-V Verification Test Bench and the CORE-V MCU projects.

Additionally, we look at the OpenHW core-v-verif GitHub repository, the distributed workflow in place, as well as the branching strategy used to manage multiple CORE-V core verification projects within a single repository.

In this webinar, you will get insights from Tim Saxe (CTO at QuickLogic) and Aimee Sutton (Platform Engineer at Metrics) alongside Mike Thompson and Florian Zaruba (both Directors of Engineering at OpenHW Group).
