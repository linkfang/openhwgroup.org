## Presentation: 'Jump start your RISC-V project with OpenHW'
The OpenHW Group are joined by Imperas, Futurewei, Silicon Labs and EM Microelectronic.
This paper will address the verification methodology adopted by the OpenHW Verification Task Group to assure commercial standards for quality. Attendees will obtain the ability to use the OpenHW verification environment as a baseline to design and verify a custom RISCV core with their own value-add features.
