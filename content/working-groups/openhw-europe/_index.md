The OpenHW Group is a not-for-profit, global organization driven by its members and individual contributors where hardware and software designers collaborate in the development of open-source cores, related IP, tools and software. OpenHW provides an infrastructure for hosting high quality open-source HW developments in line with industry best practices.

The goal of the OpenHW Europe Working Group (EWG) is to reflect European needs for digital sovereignty in the structure of the OpenHW Group, its activities and in the management of its data assets. The OpenHW Group works closely with European stakeholders and funders in the development of its work programs.Â 

The specific tasks of the EWG are outlined below:

-   Working with OpenHW Group and Eclipse Foundation (EF) staff, to establish, own and operate a Europe-located OpenHW Group code repository,
-   To enable participation by OpenHW Group staff and members in European Projects,
-   To facilitate discussion of European strategic requirements and potentially to incubate OpenHW Group Project Concepts arising from that discussion,
-   To carry out European marketing initiatives for the OpenHW Group.

Note that EWG will not of itself undertake open-source or standardization projects but may recommend that projects be initiated by the OpenHW Group by developing and presenting Project Concept proposals to the OpenHW Group Technical Working Group (TWG).

EWG reports to the Board of Director (BoD) of OpenHW Group, in parallel with the OpenHW Group Technical and Marketing WGs.
