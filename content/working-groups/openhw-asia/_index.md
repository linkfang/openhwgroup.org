The OpenHW Group is a not-for-profit, global organization driven by its members and individual contributors where hardware and software designers collaborate in the development of open-source cores, related IP, tools, and software. OpenHW provides an infrastructure for hosting high quality open-source HW developments in line with industry best practices.

The overarching goal of the Asia Working Group (AWG) is to reflect needs in Asia for digital sovereignty in the structure of the OpenHW Group, its activities and in the management of its data assets.  OpenHW Group will work closely with Asian stakeholders and funders in the development of its work programs. By organizing AWG for these goals, OpenHW Group, and the Eclipse Foundation (EF) will gain considerable insight regarding strategic and technical requirements of Asian stakeholders.

The specific tasks of AWG, are detail below:

-   Working with OpenHW Group and EF staff, to establish, own and operate a location in Asia for OpenHW Group code repository,
-   To enable participation by OpenHW Group staff and members in projects across Asia,
-   To facilitate discussion of strategic requirements in Asia and potentially to incubate OpenHW Group Project Concepts arising from that discussion,
-   To carry out Asian marketing initiatives for the OpenHW Group. 

Note that AWG will not of itself undertake open-source or standardization projects but may recommend that projects be initiated by the OpenHW Group by developing and presenting Project Concept proposals to the OpenHW Group Technical Working Group (TWG).

AWG reports to the Board of Director (BoD) of OpenHW Group, in parallel with the OpenHW Group Technical and Marketing WGs.
