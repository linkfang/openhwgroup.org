The OpenHW Asia Working Group (AWG) focuses on the Asian ecosystem requirements for open processor, hardware, and related software, while  reflecting Asian requirements for digital sovereignty in the  management of OpenHW Group’s data assets. 

Specific tasks of AWG include

-   Working with OpenHW Group and EF staff, to determine Asian data sovereignty requirements for OpenHW Group's code repository,
-   To form links, liaise with, and align goals with Asian open hardware stakeholder groups, 
-   To analyze open hardware requirements in Asia, develop a roadmap for open hardware projects meeting Asian requirements,  and  to incubate OpenHW Group Projects arising from that discussion,
-   To carry out Asian marketing initiatives for the OpenHW Group in conjunction with Asian partner organizations.

AWG will not itself undertake open-source or standardization projects but will prepare and present Project Concept proposals to the OpenHW Group Technical Working Group (TWG).

AWG is organized as an Eclipse Foundation Working Group and reports to the Board of Directors (BoD) of OpenHW Group, in parallel with the OpenHW Group Technical and Marketing WGs.
