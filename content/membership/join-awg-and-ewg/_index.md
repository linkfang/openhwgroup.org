# Instructions for joining OpenHW Europe and Asia Working Groups

The OpenHW Europe Working Group (EWG) and OpenHW Asia Working Group (AWG), focusing on the open-hardware requirements of Europe and Asia, respectively, have been created.  Their governing charters can be found at [OpenHW Europe Charter](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/openhw-europe-charter.php) and [OpenHW Asia Charter](https://www.eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/openhw-asia-charter.php).

EWG and AWG are organized under the Working Group Process of the Eclipse Foundation AISBL. Therefore the [Eclipse Foundation Antitrust Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Eclipse_Antitrust_Policy.pdf), the [Eclipse Foundation IP Policy](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Eclipse_IP_Policy.pdf), and the [Eclipse Community Code of Conduct](https://www.eclipse.org/org/documents/Community_Code_of_Conduct.php) govern their operation. Note that the logo of EWG and AWG members, as already shared with the OpenHW Group may be displayed by Eclipse Foundation to indicate members' participation in the EWG and AWG.

# How To Join EWG and AWG

All contributing members of OpenHW Group (Platinum, Gold & Silver (excluding Supporter)) are also Eclipse Foundation members and may join either or both the OpenHW EWG and AWG. There are no additional fees for participating. To participate, send an email to <membership@openhwgroup.org> stating which working group you are joining, who will serve as the point(s) of contact, and a commitment to follow the Eclipse Foundation policies and processes and logo use as described above.

You may join the mailing lists for these working groups at [EWG Mailing List Signup](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/openhw-europe-wg) and [AWG Mailing List Signup](https://accounts.eclipse.org/mailing-list/openhw-asia-wg).
